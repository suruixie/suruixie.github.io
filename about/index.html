	I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Houston.
	I received a B.E. degree in Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering in 2011 and a M.E. degree in Geodesy and Survey Engineering in 2014, both from Wuhan University.
	In 2020, I completed a Ph.D. degree in Geology at the University of South Florida. Before joining the University of Houston, I was a Scripps Postdoctoral Scholar at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego. <br>
	<br>
	My research uses satellite, terrestrial, and marine geodetic techniques to investigate Earthâ€™s topography and its deformation over time in critical zones, primarily applied to study of crustal deformation, coastal subsidence, and changes in the cryosphere. <br>
	<br>
	In my spare time, I enjoy going for a hike with my wife and kids. I also like playing basketball and watching games. <br>
