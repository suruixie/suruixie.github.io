	I am currently a Scripps Postdoctoral Scholar at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego. I completed my Ph.D. in Geology at the University of South Florida in 2020.<br>
	<br>
	My research uses satellite, terrestrial, and marine geodetic techniques to investigate Earthâ€™s topography and its deformation over time in critical zones, primarily applied to study of crustal deformation, coastal subsidence, and changes in the cryosphere. <br>
	<br>
	In my spare time, I enjoy hiking with my wife and kids. I also like playing basketball. <br>
