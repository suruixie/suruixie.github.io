		   where strain accumulation and release processes are poorly monitored.
		   The system consists of an anchored spar buoy topped by high‐precision GPS. 
		   Orientation of the buoy is measured using a digital compass that provides heading, pitch, and roll information. 
		   The combined orientation and GPS tracking data are used to recover the three‐dimensional position of the seafloor marker (anchor).
		   Instrumentation and our test results are detailed in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JB018242" style="color:#0000FF;">Xie et al. (2019)</a>.

		    We developed new methods to reduce errors in topography mapping with terrestrial radar interferometry.
		    Now we are able to map elevation changes with decimeter precision over a wide area.
		    Applying the new methods to data obtained in 2016, we found that icebergs are inhibited from moving into the fjord of Jakobshavn Isbræ during an unusually long period, due to buttressing force by a tightly packed pro-glacial mélange wedge, which is similar to a doorstop.
