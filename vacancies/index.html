<h4 style="margin-bottom:0.5em; margin-top:1em; font-size:1.5em;" >------------------------------------------------------ <br> Two fully funded Ph.D. positions in the Geosensing Program at the University of Houston </h4>

<p style="margin-top:0.1em; margin-bottom:3em; line-height:120%; font-size:1.1em;">
	Two Ph.D. research assistant positions are available in the Geosensing Systems Engineering & Sciences (GSES) program at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Houston. 
	Starting as early as Fall 2022, the successful applicants will work with Dr. Surui Xie to investigate Earthâ€™s topography and deformation over time in critical zones. 
	The group emphasizes the use of geodetic techniques to study crustal deformation, coastal subsidence and sea level change, as well as changes in the cryosphere.<br>		
	<br>
	
	The Ph.D. assistantship provides 5 years of support, including tuition, stipend, health insurance, etc. 
	Students with educational background in Geodesy, Geomatics, Remote Sensing, Earth and Ocean Sciences, Mathematics, or Computer Science are particularly encouraged to apply. 
	If interested, please contact Dr. Surui Xie (<a href="mailto:suxie@ucsd.edu" style="color:#0000FF;">suxie@ucsd.edu</a>), with a CV and brief research statement. 
	Review of applications will start immediately and will continue until the positions are filled. 
	Applications may also be submitted directly following the instructions at <a href="https://www.cive.uh.edu/admissions/civil-engineering/application-forms" style="color:#0000FF;">https://www.cive.uh.edu/admissions/civil-engineering/application-forms</a> (please indicate Surui Xie as potential advisor if you would like to work with me). 
	The deadline for admission into the graduate program of Geosensing Systems for the Fall semester is May 15th; and the deadline for the Spring semester is October 15th.

<h4 style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top:1.5em; font-size:1.5em;" >------------------------------------------------------ <br> Postdoctoral Scholar -- Machine Learning in Geodesy/Geophysics/Remote Sensing </h4>

<p style="margin-top:0.1em; margin-bottom:3em; line-height:120%; font-size:1.1em;">
	The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Houston invites applications for a postdoctoral position to advance geodetic, geophysical, or remote sensing data analysis using machine learning. 
	The postdoctoral researcher will work with Dr. Surui Xie in the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping to detect and investigate transient events (e.g., slow slip) in GNSS time series and/or other types of geodetic/geophysical/remote sensing datasets.<br> 
	<br>
	
	The postdoctoral position is for two years and can be extended for an additional year upon satisfactory review. 
	The position will offer a highly competitive salary, benefits, and support for travel and professional development. 
	The start date is expected to be September 1, 2022, but is flexible. The successful candidate must have a Ph.D. degree by the start date and demonstrated experience in machine learning. 
	Experience in geodetic data analysis is desired but not required. 
	With the goal of establishing an independent research program and a successful career path, the postdoc is encouraged to participate in professional development and proposal writing (as PI or Co-PI).<br>
	<br>
	
	To apply, please send the application material to Surui Xie (<a href="mailto:suxie@ucsd.edu" style="color:#0000FF;">suxie@ucsd.edu</a>), which should include:<br>
	<br>
	
	1) A CV including publication and presentation lists 	<br>
	2) A research statement with a description of research experience and plan 	<br>
	3) The names and contact information of at least three references 	<br>
	<br>
	
	Review of applications will begin on June 1, 2022 and will continue until the position is filled. 
	If you wish your application to be reviewed early, please specify that in the email so I can expedite the review process of your application.<br>
