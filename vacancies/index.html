<h4 style="margin-bottom:1em; margin-top:1em; font-size:1.5em;" >Two fully funded Ph.D. positions in the Geosensing Program at the University of Houston </h4>

<p style="line-height:120%; font-size:1.1em;">
	Two Ph.D. research assistant positions are available in the Geosensing Systems Engineering & Sciences (GSES) program at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Houston. 
	Starting as early as Fall 2022, the successful applicants will work with Dr. Surui Xie (suxie@ucsd.edu) to investigate Earthâ€™s topography and deformation over time in critical zones. 
	The group emphasizes the use of geodetic techniques to study crustal deformation, coastal subsidence and sea level change, as well as changes in the cryosphere.<br>		
	<br>
	
	The Ph.D. assistantship provides 5 years of support, including tuition, stipend, health insurance, etc. 
	Students with educational background in Geodesy, Geomatics, Remote Sensing, Earth and Ocean Sciences, Mathematics, or Computer Science are particularly encouraged to apply. 
	If interested, please contact Dr. Surui Xie (suxie@ucsd.edu), with a CV and brief research statement. 
	Review of applications will start immediately and will continue until the positions are filled. 
	Applications may also be submitted directly following the instructions at https://www.cive.uh.edu/admissions/civil-engineering/application-forms (list Surui Xie as potential advisor). 
	The deadline for admission into the graduate program of Geosensing Systems for the Fall semester is May 15th; and the deadline for the Spring semester is October 15th.
